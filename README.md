# Dynamo to AxisVM with *AxisVM Export*

The *AxisVM Export* Dynamo package enables creating structural models and exports them to [AxisVM](https://www.axisvm.eu) structural analysis and design software. AxisVM Export is a parametric interface for AxisVM, utilizing Dynamo. 

The *AxisVM Export* plugin communicates with AxisVM through its API ([COM interface](http://axisvm.eu/axisvm_products_programming.html)). The export requires that AxisVM and a version of [Dyanamo](http://dynamobim.org) (Dynamo Studio or Dynamo extension of Revit) are all installed on the same computer. After starting the export, AxisVM will automatically launch, showing the exported model. You can modify this AxisVM model just by modifying the Dynamo parameters (e.g, geometric properties, cross-section size), and the AxisVM model will update automatically.
