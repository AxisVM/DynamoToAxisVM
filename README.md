# Dynamo to AxisVM with *AxisVM Export*

The *AxisVM Export* Dynamo plugin enables creating structural models and exports them to [AxisVM](https://www.axisvm.eu) structural analysis and design software. AxisVM Export is a parametric interface for AxisVM, utilizing Dynamo. 

The *AxisVM Export* plugin communicates with AxisVM through its [COM interface](http://axisvm.eu/axisvm_products_programming.html). The export requires that AxisVM and a version of [Dyanamo](http://dynamobim.org) (Dynamo Studio or Dynamo extension of Revit) are all installed on the same computer. After starting the export, AxisVM will automatically launch, showing the exported model.

For installation and details read the [Wiki](https://github.com/AxisVM/DynamoToAxisVM/wiki).
